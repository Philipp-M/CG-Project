At the end there will be a merry-go-around with ultimative effects, like bumpmapping and all this fancy stuff...

current state: obj, textures, lightning and bumpmapping are working, even a big scene like the rungholt castle with 12 Million vertices seems to be no problem(provided that the gpu can handle it)

The one and only Merry-Go-Arround:
